**Supply Chain Dashboard for Just In Time**

### Project Summary

This project tackles real-world supply chain data to uncover inefficiencies in inventory and shipment management for the company *Just In Time*. Using Tableau, the goal is to build an interactive dashboard that summarizes key insightsâ€”such as supply-demand imbalance, overstock/understock issues, and shipment delaysâ€”and propose data-driven business improvements.
