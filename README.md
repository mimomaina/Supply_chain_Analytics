# Supply_chain_Analytics

## Introduction

This project explores the supply chain operations of "Just In Time", a retail and logistics company, using data from January 2015 to December 2017. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, product preferences, shipment efficiency, and inventory management to uncover actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Objective

To uncover supply chain inefficiencies, understand customer purchasing trends, and recommend improvements in operations, fulfillment, and inventory handling based on historical order, inventory, and fulfillment data.

## Dataset Description

The project utilizes three main CSV files:

- `orders_and_shipments.csv`: Contains customer orders, shipping details, shipment delays, and order values.
- `inventory.csv`: Includes monthly inventory levels, storage costs per product, and product categories.
- `fulfillment.csv`: Provides data on average fulfillment times per warehouse and product.

## Key Business Questions

1.How many customers are returning customers?
2.Which product categories are most popular?
3.How long does it take to ship products from the warehouse to the customer,on average?
4.Which is the least most effective shipping method?
5.What are the average shipping days for each customer market?


## Tools Used

- Tableau (Data visualization and dashboard design)
- SQL (Preliminary data cleaning,transformation and data manipulation)
- GitHub (Version control and project documentation)
